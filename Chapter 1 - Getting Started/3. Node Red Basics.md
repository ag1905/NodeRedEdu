# Node-RED Basics

## Overview of Node-RED 

### What is Node-RED? What does Node-RED do? 

Node-RED is a browser-based editor, run on Node.js, that connects a wide range of nodes to create functions and flows that can be deployed in real-time. It is software tool developed by IBM for wiring together hardware devices, different APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Node-RED is especially useful in pairing together IoT devices, Raspberry Pi's, databases, blockchain fabrics and much more. Node-RED can be run on Bluemix (in the cloud) or locally. Both have the same functionality, but different ways of installing node palettes. 

## How To Use the Course

### What Is the Best Way To Use This Course?

To begin, watch the videos linked at the top of the document to set up your Bluemix account and install your Node Red instance ("Setting up Bluemix" module). This course is going to use Node Red on a Bluemix environment, but it will be fine if you want to work locally. It is recommended to put the video in half of your screen (or ideally another monitor) and put your own Node-RED instance in the other half of the screen. This way you can program with the video. If you still need more support after watching the video, refer to the step-by-step tutorial of the flow. If you are still having trouble, import the complete flow code that is in the section directory. Flow code is denoted as .flow or .json files.

### How to Import & Export Code

#### Import Instructions

1. Click the three bar menu in the top right corner. <img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/menu_icon.png" width="30">

2. Import > Clipboard

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/import_clipboard.png">

3. Paste code into the text box. 

- "Import To: Current Flow" will import the flow into the same tab you are currently working in. 
- "Import To: New Flow" will import the flow into a new tab. 

4. Click import.

#### Importing the Complete Flow Code

1. Click on the associated flow code for the module you are working in, the .flow or .json files. 

2. Copy all of the code in the file. 

3. Complete the import instructions above. 

#### Export Instructions

1. Highlight the nodes that you want to export by clicking down and gliding the mouse over the nodes you want. If the node is selected, it will have a orange box around the node. 

2. Click the three bar menu in the top right corner. <img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/menu_icon.png" width="30">

3. Export > Clipboard

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/export_clipboard.png">

4. Highlight all of the code and copy it. 

5. Use the import instructions above to import the flow into Node-RED. 

**Note about the clipboard:** If you save your code to the clipboard, it will only be accessible in other tabs of your current Node-RED instance. If you want to move flows to different instances, copy and paste the code into your buffer. 

### How to Install New Nodes

#### If you are running on Bluemix:

1. Click the three bar menu in the top right corner. <img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/menu_icon.png" width="30">

2. Click on manage palette. 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/manage.png" height="500">

3. Click the install tab.

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/install_tab.png" height="500">

4. Type in the name of the palette you want to download. 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/install_mysql.png">

5. Press the install button next to the package. 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/install_mysql2.png">

6. Click close.

**Note:** If your new node doesn't automatically show up in your palette, refresh your Node-RED browser.

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/install_close.png">

#### If you are running locally: 

1. Go on the npm website and find the palette that you want to download.

2. Copy the command under the install tab. 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/npm_mysql.png">

3. Open the terminal and run the command.

  - Ex. If you want to download the Node-RED MySQL nodes, run the command
  
``` javascript
npm install node-red-node-mysql
```
4. The palette will install on your local Node-RED instance. 

### How To Deploy & Inject

#### Deploy 

Everytime you create a new Node-RED flow and for every change you make to the flow, you must press the deploy buttom in the top right part of your Node-RED screen. The deploy button ensures that the flow and nodes are configured properly.

If the flow is *not* deployed, the button will be red. 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/deploy.png" width="200"> 

If the flow *is* deployed, the button will be gray.

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/deploy_gray.png" width="200"> 

#### Inject

If your flow begins with an inject node, you must press the blue buttom to the left to begin the flow and inject the data.

### How To Open the Debug Tab

To see the results from your debug nodes, you need to open up the debug console/tab. On your screen, look at the right panel. 

Click on the debug tab. 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/debug_arrow.png">

This is where your results will be printed! 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/debug_result.png">

If this panel is not there, click on the right edge of your screen and move your mouse left.

### How To Turn Off Debug Messages

If you do not want to see a debug message and you don't want to delete the node, simply click the green button to the right of the debug node. 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/debug_button.png">

If the debug node looks like this, the debug messages will print: 

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/debug_on.png">

If the debug node looks like this, the debug messages will *not* print:

<img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/debug_off.png">

### How To Clear the Debug Tab

In your debug tab, click the trash can button to clear the screen.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

If you like using your 

1. Click the three bar menu in the top right corner. <img src="../Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started/Screenshots/menu_icon.png" width="30">

2. Click "Keyboard shortcuts".

3. Scroll to explore the many keyboard shortcuts. 

Some favorites are:

  - To edit the node, click enter.
  - To search for a node, click ⌘f
  - To undo, click ⌘z

### "I'm not getting the results as shown. What do I do?"

Go back through the video and/or the written instructions to make sure is configured properly. Re-copy and paste the code portions to make sure there aren't syntactical errors. 

In your function nodes: 
- Is there a semi-colon at the end of each line? 
- Are there equal parenthesis? For each open parenthesis "(", is there a matching closing parenthesis ")"?

Some other things to check: 
- Did you deploy before you injected the code? 
- Did you wire all the nodes correctly? 
- Are you service credentials correct? Re-copy and paste these to confirm. 
- Is your debug node set to print only the msg.payload or the complete msg object? 
  - The complete msg object will give you a full picture of the node's data. You might want to change this in your debug node to see if it will print. 
- Are your debug nodes active or turned off? 

If your debug node looks like the picture below, your messages will not print.
